## How to make good yogurt

1. Heat your milk to near boiling point.
2. Let it cool off to warm.
3. Heat the oven to 115F. (Absolutely not exceeding 130F)
4. Mix milk with little bit of existing yogurt culture, put in the oven for at least 8 hours, leave it overnight if you hate the wait.
5. Put yogurt in the fridge.
6. Enjoy!

Notes: 

1. If milk is not heated, the texture would be more smooth, liquidish. After heating up the milk first, the texture is more coarse, which I prefer.

2. If milk is not heated, lactose does not seem to break down during fermentation.

3. Cookware used for heating milk is extremely difficult to clean afterwards, especially stainless steel. Maybe microwave oven is the better choice.
